This project was bootstrapped with [Create React WP Theme](https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme).

To use:

```sh
cd /your/wordpress/themes/folder
git clone https://github.com/devloco/create-react-wptheme-example-celestial.git
rename create-react-wptheme-example-celestial celestial
cd celestial
cd react-src
npm start
```

I went through this tutorial:

[How To Build A Skin For Your Web App With React And WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/react-wordpress-web-app/)

...only up to the "posts" part. I haven't yet gotten to the wooCommerce part of the tutorial.

The original Github repo for the Celestial theme is located here: [Celestial WordPress theme](https://github.com/m-muhsin/celestial)
